groups and corporate entities comes together to help communities and individuals in Africa. In practical terms, HH ORG adopts projects that are deemed

Brief Project Aim:

The project aims to provide a simple but clearly intuitive web platform where any individual can access all necessary information about HH Org.
My main focus was to be able to have platform where everyone irrespective of their educational background will be able to all the information they might need
about the foundation, keeping in mind that the platform would not only serve for the sponsors but also for those that are beneficiaries whom 
might not be of sound educational background.

Hence the main focus is create a simple but comprehensive platform for all.

After the course I took time to study different NGO'S web platform, an example is: https://www.peacedirect.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw17n1BRDEARIsAFDHFezjj_9URJ2AQw7dwh1Xc63e6H_rHe5WgyJl1Qso68NHzTYV-rvm8V4aAuswEALw_wcB.
After which I was able to have a distinctive idea of what i seek to achieve.
