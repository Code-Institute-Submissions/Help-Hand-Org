Front End Development Milestone Project.

Name Of Project: HELPING HANDS ORG.

Helping Hands ORG is a non profitable foundation based in Sweden, the foundation serves as a platform where individuals, groups and corporate entities comes together to help communities and individuals in Africa. In practical terms, HH ORG adopts projects that are deemed benefical after intensive researches, members(Private and corporate) are then contacted through a thorough project proposal after which interested sponsors registers their interest. 

In over 5 years HH ORG has undertaken over 210 Major community projects like: Building & renovation of classrooms, providing study materials,sponsorship of 56 girl child Education projects, and community water bore-hole projects.

Brief Project Aim:

The project aims to provide a simple but clearly intuitive web platform where any individual can access all necessary information about HH Org. My main focus was to be able to have a web platform where everyone irrespective of their educational background will be able to understand the information they need about the foundation, keeping in mind that the platform would not only serve for the members, sponsors but also for those that are beneficiaries whom might not be of sound educational background.
Hence the main focus is create a simple but comprehensive platform for all.

After the course I took time to study different NGO'S web platform, an example is:

 After which I was able to have a distinctive idea of what i seek to achieve.
 
Projects Further Details:

Present User Experience:

•	The project focuses mainly on giving all necessary information to the potential and active members, however beneficiaries individual and communities can also access necessary information to understand what the foundation does and stands for.

•	Information where provided in short and clear method in order to avoid much texts and thus making visitors not interested in reading them.

•	Relevant icons where used to help people understand what was being presented even before reading the information text.

•	Although not much texts are provided at the surface level, vistors in future will have the options of reading further and getting more information they need on their own.


The following features were added for a simple and Clear User Experience:

1.	Navbar: This is designed to link users to the different sections, each bar linking directly to whatever information the users seek.

2.	Home: The landing page is a 3 pages carousel, however for the purpose of this project the other 2 carousel were frozen out(see commented carouesl). The Home display a picture of what the mission of the Foundation is all about, and a link to more detailed information about the Foundation(To be further developed).

3.	About Us: The core mission of the foundation and it's "modus operandi" were clearly itemized for easy User Understanding.

4.	Area of Interest: This section is designed for optimal self description by using Icons that represents the area of interest so that user can even know what they are about reading by just looking at the icons;

•	A computer to represent education. 

•	A Vigilant eye to show "watching out" for child labour offenders. 

•	The circle represents "GENDERLESS", every child irrespective of gender deserves education. 

•	The bell to let you know we will alarm the government to every child Marriage. 

•	The Open padlock represents open opportunities that seems impossible to these communities.

•	And the link icon represent connectivity with other agencies.

The text of each icons are simple and explains what each area represents, visitors that seek further information will be able to explore further by clicking on each link.

5.	Contact Us: The contact us sections provide different avenues for the users to contact the foundation, email, phone number, and a form for easy messaging were all provided and a google location map for easy direction. The Contact form information are mandated to be required before submission can be effected.

6.	The footer: Easy access to all social media platforms, links to the different sections and area of Interest, a subscribe button was also provided and contact informations were all provided again.

Future Aims for the Project:

After submission assessment and grading, I intend to work further on this project when I have acquired more competence with JavaScript.

I intend to added the following features to the projects:

•	Gallery Section: Pictures and videos of past project by the Foundation will be on display in this section for visitors to see how much the foundation has achieved over the years.

•	News Section: A section whereby visitors and members can get updated recent informations about projects, meetings and all important information.

•	Policy: A link to legal terms and conditions for membership, adoption of project e.t.c

•	Our Team: This section will give access to the short information about the global governing council and administrative staff.

CONTENT AND CREATIVE IDEA.


The contents are solely mine however I must put on record that ideas and creativity were as a result of studying other useful learning materials online.

Programming Languages: 

This project uses HTML5, CSS4 & JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.

Technologies and Platforms:

•	This project is Bootstrap Oriented,Bootstrap CDN, Fontawesome and icon links were used. 

•	Additional font were imported and used.

•	Responsive Javascripts links were imported and used for the project. 

•	Github was used as the primary store. 

•	Git to handle Version Control. 

•	Gitpod to create workspaces.

Testing: 


Since the project is Static, some of the features are not operational however the following were done to test the website:

The Navbars to ensure everyone is operational and that it directs the user to the right sections. 

The landing page pictures and other pictures used displays correctly. All links and buttons are labelled and texted correctly. 

The map used is sized correctly and functional. The contact form details must be filled appropriately before submission.


Deployment:

I followed the tuturial by Code Institute Instructor on how to safely commit our Projects using:

•	git init

•	git status 

•	git add .

•	git commit -m "first commit" .

•	git status git push

And got the link: https://github.com/Tayo-bet/Help-Hand-Org

Link to Deployed Website: https://tayo-bet.github.io/Help-Hand-Org/

Challenges and Limitation.

Many ideas and creative concepts I have for the project are un achieveable right now due to the scope of my knowledge, I however will seek to implement them in the future after completing Javascript and Jquery Modules in the course.


Credits: 
I wish to aknowledge my mentor, Dick Vlaanderen who has not only been of immense support but has gone beyond being a mentor to guide in building this project. The student care support at Code Institute always checking on me to follow up my progress and the Tutors who are never tired of helping out even when atimes the question are odd.
